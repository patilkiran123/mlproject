# Student Performance Prediction Project
End to End Machine Learning Project

## Problem Statement

In the dynamic landscape of education, understanding and predicting student performance is crucial for effective academic intervention and support.  
In this context, I have developed a machine learning model to predict the math scores of students based on various features related to their demographics, background, and academic engagement.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to create a predictive model that accurately estimates the math scores of students.  
The model leverages numerical features such as reading and writing scores, as well as categorical information including gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation course completion.

## Dataset

- The dataset provided contains information on student performance, with "math_score" as the target variable.
- The numerical columns include "reading_score" and "writing_score".
- The categorical columns encompass "gender," "race_ethnicity," "parental_level_of_education," "lunch," and "test_preparation_course".

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting math scores of students based on various demographic and academic factors. The machine learning model has been developed, evaluated, and deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
